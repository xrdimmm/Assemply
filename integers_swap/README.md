# Integers Swap Program

#### The following program swaps the elements of a 32 bit integers array.
#### Given an N size array the first element is swaped with the first element at the N/2 possition of the array (a[0] <-> a[Ν/2]),  the second element with the element at the N/2 + 1 possition of the array (a[1] <-> a[Ν/2+1]) and the rest follow the same logic.
#### The number of elements in the array is always an even number in order the swaps to be possible.

### Program Variables :

* Register $a0 -> Contains the memory address of the first element in the array.
* Register $a1 -> Contains the number of integers in the array.
